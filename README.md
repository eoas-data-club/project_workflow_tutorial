Hi all! To get started, please do the following steps:

1. Clone the "project_workflow_tutorial"
2. Open RStudio and go to File > New Project. Choose the option to check out a project from version control, and paste in the repository URL
2. Pull the latest version of the repository from Github (good practice for later)
3. Open the "project_workflow_tutorial.Rmd" script
4. Save the RMarkdown script as a new file, adding your initials or a team name. This will allow us to work on the same script in the same repository without creating commit conflicts, so it's important to do first, before making other changes!
5. Check that you have all the packages we're going to be using installed in your version of RStudio.
6. Push your changes to Github
